\section{Social Events}

An important aspect of a conference like GUADEC is to meet in a less formal
environment and make new friends in the community. We plan to host multiple
social events for everyone to attend, if at all possible we will try to
provide free drinks or even free food at some of the events.

\subsection{AKK/Z10 Beer Event}

With the AKK and Z10 we have two non-profits run by the student community that
maintain bars close to the University (KIT South Campus).
Both of these locations are ideal as they are kept by volunteers and with just
a couple of volunteers of our own and relatively little money we can
server drinks to all conference attendees free of charge all night long.

\subsection{Football and Games}

It is customary for GUADEC to host a football game on one of the evenings. We will
rent a football field. By working together with a student organization at the
KIT we can rent one on the university campus free of charge.

\subsection{Picnic}

Karlsruhe has a nice parc to the south of the castle which provides a beatiful
place to play games and enjoy the day. One one evening we would like to do
a picnick in this parc. Should it be one of the hotter weeks, we could also
consider joining the many people that like to go to one of the close-by lakes
to cool down a bit ($\sim\SI{40}{\minute}$ by tram and foot).

\subsection{Center for Art and Media (ZKM)}

XXX probably makes sense to list it here, if we claim that we will organize
a tour of the ZKM. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

\subsection{Barbecue}

On the first evening we are planning to barbecue. We can provide attendees with
food and drinks troughout the evening as they are arriving in Karlsruhe.\todo{We
need to get a license to stay outside after 11pm. Likely at Z10 or AKK.}
