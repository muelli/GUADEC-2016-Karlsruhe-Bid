\subsection{Jugendherberge Karlsruhe}

\begin{labeling}{\bf Availability}
  \item[\bf Location] North West of City Center
  \item[\bf Price] $\sim\SI{25}{\euro/{pP}}$
  \item[\bf Breakfast] included
  \item[\bf Availability] after 21st August
\end{labeling}

The youth hostel is located to the south west of the city center in the middle
of one of the universities, the Hochschule Karlsruhe. The walk to the
next tram station is about \SI{10}{\minute}. While this location would be
pretty affordable, it is heavily used by groups during the summer, and will
not be available to us from the start of Juli till the 21st of August.

Note that it is mandatory to get half-board or a lunch pack for at least some
of the days. The price mentioned here is an estimation that already includes
the extra costs this incurs.
