\section{Accommodation}

A\&O, the hostel situated next to the train station (and hence about 35 minutes by foot from the venue) costs about \SI{10}{\euro} for shared accommodation. Private dorms are also available for the cost of \SI{25}{\euro}. 

As we would like to keep everyone located in the same area, we would like to host keynote speakers rooms at the hotel Ibis located just on the other side of the train station. 
Alternatively, B\&B, another hostel, is offering rooms for about \SI{10}{\euro} per person sharing if need be. 

Notes Benjamin:
 * For layouting it may make sense to change this into "lets host people in these places"
   and then add some more hostels/hotels that may be interesting.
 * look at travel experimentaiton that I was doing
