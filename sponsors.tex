\section{Sponsors}

This section describes how we envision to raise the money needed for running the event.

Karlsruhe is not only a student city; it is also a hub for IT companies. Every year, events such as LEARNTEC and initiatives such as KAIT-SI or MEKA are hosted in Karlsruhe, bringing together professionals from the area of security, mobile computing and design.
We believe that hosting GUADEC 2016 in Karlsruhe can contribute to anchoring GNOME in a sustainable way in the wider network of a fast-growing IT-cluster in Germany which has its central point in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.
We further commit to closely interact with the local government, administration and tourism board to ensure that as many entities as possible are aware of the unique opportunity that an event such as GUADEC is providing to members of the GNOME community, but also to the wider public.  

We will work together with the foundation to update the existing sponsorship
brochure and will adapt it to be used by ourselves to present GUADEC and GNOME
and the different sponsorship options to potential local companies.

We intend to contact various IT companies in the region, for example SAP, Web.de, secorvo,
