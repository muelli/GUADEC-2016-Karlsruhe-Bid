\section{Venue}

We plan on hosting GUADEC 2016 at Duale Hochschule Baden-Wuerttemberg.
But in case it doesn't work out, we have alternatives.

\subsection{DHBW}
\begin{description}
\item[Location] off
\item[Price] gratis
\item[Rooms] 1 big auditorium, many small
\end{description}

DHBW offers exactly what we are looking for: A large room for keynotes 
and some smaller rooms for parallel sessions and rooms for the BoFs 
during the two-day hackfest. The rooms are all perfectly equipped with 
all one needs and the venue has a lobby which we intend to transform 
into a lounge for casual gatherings.

DHBW is located in the northern part of Karlsruhe. It is in walking 
distance of the inner city. It is also in walking distance of the 
accommodation that we are suggesting. We are nonetheless in discussion 
with the local tourism office to arrange for reduced fares for public 
transport to render the access to the venue even easier.

However, the location is a bit bad for lunch, because it is a bit off the centre.

The venue is available from the end of July on.


\subsection{ZKM}
\begin{description}
\item[Location] very god
\item[Price] unknown, up to 5000 EUR
\item[Rooms] multiple big auditoriums, few small
\end{description}

An alternative to the DHBW is Zentrum f√ºr Kunst und Medientechnologie (ZKM).

ZKM offers large auditorium which would be perfect for hosting the AGM
and the GSoC Student Talks. There are also a few smaller rooms 
available for parallel sessions. As one cannot visit Karlsruhe without 
spending some time at ZKM, the end of the day on Sunday will be 
dedicated to visit this particularly interactive museum.


In the unlikely event of things not going the way they should, 
alternative options such as hosting the event entirely at ZKM or 
relocating to either Karlshochschule or the universiy,
right in the heart of the inner city, have already been considered and can be activated if required.
However, additional costs might occur, especially if we spend the
entire time at ZKM.


The venue is available from from 2015-08-12 until 2015-08-14.


\subsection{University}
\begin{description}
\item[Location] very good
\item[Price] unknown, up to 5000 EUR
\item[Rooms] multiple big auditoriums, many small
\end{description}

A third option is the local university.

However, no commitment could obtained.
It is very well located and would have great infrastructure.
But so far, we haven't found sufficient support from local professors.
But we are working on it.


\subsection{Karlshochschule}
\begin{description}
\item[Location] very good
\item[Price] unknown
\item[Rooms] unknown
\end{description}

Another option is the centrally located Karlshochschule.
Again, no commitment could be obtained, because they are not reacting
to our emails.

Notes Benjamin:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Totally against two different venues for core days
 \item DHBW is fine, would want to provide catering in that case; also far away from university (e.g. Z10/AKK, Football)
 \item Would suggest detailed profile of DHBW with short profiles of other locations that we have already investigated
\end{itemize}
