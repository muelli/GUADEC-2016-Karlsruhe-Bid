\section{Venue}


We plan on hosting GUADEC 2016 at DHBW on Friday, Saturday, Monday and 
Tuesday and to spend Sunday at ZKM.

DHBW offers exactly what we are looking for: A large room for keynotes 
and some smaller rooms for parallel sessions and rooms for the BoFs 
during the two-day hackfest. The rooms are all perfectly equipped with 
all one needs and the venue has a lobby which we intend to transform 
into a lounge for casual gatherings.

ZKM offers large auditorium which would be perfect for hosting the AGM 
and the GSoC Student Talks. There are also a few smaller rooms 
available for parallel sessions. As one cannot visit Karlsruhe without 
spending some time at ZKM, the end of the day on Sunday will be 
dedicated to visit this particularly interactive museum.

DHBW is located in the northern part of Karlsruhe. It is in walking 
distance of the inner city. It is also in walking distance of the 
accommodation that we are suggesting. We are nonetheless in discussion 
with the local tourism office to arrange for reduced fares for public 
transport to render the access to the venue even easier.

In the unlikely event of things not going the way they should, 
alternative options such as hosting the event entirely at ZKM or 
relocating to the Karlshochschule, right in the heart of the inner 
city, have already been considered and can be activated if required. 
However, additional costs might occur, especially if we spend the 
entire time at ZKM.


Notes Benjamin:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Totally against two different venues for core days
 \item DHBW is fine, would want to provide catering in that case; also far away from university (e.g. Z10/AKK, Football)
 \item Would suggest detailed profile of DHBW with short profiles of other locations that we have already investigated
\end{itemize}
