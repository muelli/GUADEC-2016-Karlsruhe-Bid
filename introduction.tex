Let's start out with some trivialities that might convince you all that 
hosting GUADEC in Karlsruhe in 2016 is a brilliant idea. Karlsruhe is 
Germany's sunniest city. Karlsruhe is situated in the Southern part of 
Germany, hence not only easily accessible from other European 
Countries, but also from abroad as it is close enough to Frankfurt 
international airport and Stuttgart airport. Karlsruhe combines a 
strong sense for science and technology - think KIT\footnote{Karlsruhe 
Institute of Technology}, FZI\footnote{Forschungszentrum Informatik} 
and Frauenhofer Institute–with a penchant for creativity and 
design–think ZKM\footnote{Zentrum für Kunst und Medien}. Karlsruhe is a 
typical “student city” with affordable accommodation and cheap meals. 
The city hosts 4 higher education institutes offering computer science 
related degrees. As we plan a particular student pre-event to tap into 
this student pool, the potential of growing the GNOME community is 
guaranteed.

%Karlsruhe is the perfect place to host GUADEC 2016.
