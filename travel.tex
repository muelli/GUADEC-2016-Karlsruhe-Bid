\subsection{Local public transport}



The local public transport system (KVV) is a tight network of buses and trams connecting not only the different part within the city, but anchoring the city in the wider context of Baden-WÃ¼rthemberg. The organizing committee is committed to investigate the possibility to get special day passes for all participants for the duration of the event. Alternatively there are day passes for 5 people for 9euros.

Karlsruhe is a compact city. The trip from the train station (southern end of Karlsruhe) to the venue (north east end) for instance takes just under 35 Minutes.



Notes Benjamin:
 * This is *not* the document describing travel options to attendees.
 * Would not recommand Frankfurt Hahn; it is far away and not really easy to reach
 * Umweltplakete: does not belong into bid; for website just provide info how one can park outside without entering (i.e. Waldparkplatz)
 * Car: If at all, then reason why reachable for a lot of people using this method (KA is central in Europe)
 * need to think about how to write the text, thinking of a short summary sentence and the important details in a tabular format. Also consider layout for document!
