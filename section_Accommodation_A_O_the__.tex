A&O, the hostel situated next to the train station (and hence about 35 minutes by foot from the venue) costs about 10 for shared accommodation. Private dorms are also available for the cost of 25 euros. 

As we would like to keep everyone located in the same area, we would like to host keynote speakers rooms at the hotel Ibis located just on the other side of the train station. 
Alternatively, B&B, another hostel, is offering rooms for about 25 euros per person sharing if need be.
